# PathFinder Game

## Overview

PathFinder is a one-player navigating game. The objective of PathFinder is to navigate through a grid from a given starting point to reach the designated ending point. PathFinder offers three levels: Easy, Medium, and Hard, which determine the grid size and complexity. The player needs to wisely decide which square to step on to get to the ending point. The player can move horizontally or vertically to adjacent squares on the grid, but diagonal moves are not allowed. If the player chooses the correct path and reaches the ending point, they win the game. If the player lands on an incorrect square, they are returned to the starting point.
